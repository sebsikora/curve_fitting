What is it?
-------------------------

This IPython notebook forms a tutorial that I wrote some years ago while working as a research fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Leeds University.

It is a guide to using Python tools including numpy and scipy to work with research data, in this case to perform arbitrary curve-fitting, for the benefit of scientist colleagues comfortable with the algebra but uncomfortable moving beyond Microsoft Excel or the odd bit of Matlab to perform their analyses.
