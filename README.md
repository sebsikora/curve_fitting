What is it?
-------------------------

This IPython notebook forms a tutorial that I wrote some years ago while working as a research fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Leeds University.

It is a guide to using Python tools including numpy and scipy to work with research data, in this case to perform arbitrary curve-fitting, for the benefit of scientist colleagues comfortable with the algebra but uncomfortable moving beyond Microsoft Excel or the odd bit of Matlab to perform their analyses.

More broadly, the same approach can be used to solve for unknowns in any multivariate scalar function, via constrained minimisation.
